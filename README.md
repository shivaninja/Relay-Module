# Relay Module (VCC–GND–SIG) | KiCad Design
## Overview

This project is a custom-designed relay module developed using KiCad, intended for microcontroller-based control of high-voltage or high-current loads. The module provides a simple 3-pin control interface (VCC, GND, SIG) and standard relay output terminals (NO, NC, COM), making it compatible with platforms such as Arduino, ESP32, and STM32.

The design focuses on simplicity, reliability, and ease of integration in embedded systems.

## Features

3-pin control interface: VCC, GND, SIG

Relay output terminals:

NO (Normally Open)

NC (Normally Closed)

COM (Common)

Transistor-based relay driving circuit

Flyback diode protection for relay coil

Compact PCB layout

Designed fully in KiCad (schematic + PCB)

## Pin Description
Control Header
Pin	Description
VCC	Supply voltage for relay module
SIG	Control signal from MCU GPIO
GND	Ground
Relay Output Terminal
Terminal	Function
NO	Connected to COM when relay is energized
NC	Connected to COM when relay is not energized
COM	Common contact

## Working Principle

The SIG pin controls a transistor that drives the relay coil.

When the control signal is asserted, the relay energizes and switches the COM contact from NC to NO.

A flyback diode protects the transistor from voltage spikes generated by the relay coil.

The module allows low-voltage microcontrollers to safely control high-power loads.
